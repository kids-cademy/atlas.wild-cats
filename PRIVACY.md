It is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to be used as a quick reference on a particular subject or field. For complete reference one can visit external sources that are linked on every article.

Atlas is completely free. Free of annoying ads, no misleading in-app payment, no spy-ware. Development effort is donated. It is a humble way to show gratitude to Internet community that gives us all so much.
